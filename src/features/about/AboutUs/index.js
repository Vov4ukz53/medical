    <Paragraph>
      I no longer miss work to go to the doctor. I no longer wait hours sitting in a doctors office just to see the doctor. In the past, after seeing the doctor, I now no longer have to wait at a pharmacy to get my prescriptions filled. I now get medical treatment and prescriptions without leaving the house. I get all of this and its just a click away. Not only a click away, but its also legal.

      Todayâ€™s online pharmacies has made it very convenient for people who already know what their diagnosis is, and already know what medications work for them.
